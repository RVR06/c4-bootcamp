A good architecture design is fundamental to build a stable, scalable and sustainable software system. Documenting this architecture such way that we provide required level of information to all stakeholders had always been a challenge. Thus, <b>C4 model</b> had been introduced as an <b>abstraction-first</b> approach for sketching architecture. In addition, to easily maintain and keep this documentation up to date, a second approach, named <b>architecture as a code</b>, enables to document the architecture design based on textual model. The combination of both brings a robust strategy for documenting and maintain any architecture design.

During <a href="/docs">our journey</a>, we stressed all the benefits one could expect from moving towards <b>architecture as code</b> or <b>code-first approach</b>. However, most of the journey focused on what one could expect to gain from a single model defined as code, without dwelling on how authoring this model for too long. It is now time to <a href="https://github.com/rvr06/c4-bootcamp">address this point</a>...
