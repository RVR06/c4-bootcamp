Not at the same level, not with the same legend, ...   
How one could reasonably make decision such as:
- Compare left and righ sides
- Draft coupling between left and righ sides

Time is properly used to discuss content rather than form.

As for `MVVM` pattern, we can switch between the most meaningful view for a given `software model`. Model lossless simplification eases identification & comparison (like hashing).

## Spot the differences

Compare underlying model not layout.

Basically, all you can do to ease audience grasping content, rather than losing time & mental overload, must be done.
