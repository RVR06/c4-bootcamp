# BOOTCAMP

We introduced the concept of [architecture as code or code-first approach](https://rvr06.github.io/c4-bootcamp/docs/code). We took the opportunity to leverage [Structurizr tool suite](https://rvr06.github.io/c4-bootcamp/docs/code/#structurizr) to support the end-user journey. However, most of the journey focused on what one could expect to gain from a single model defined as code, without dwelling on how authoring this model for too long. It is now time to address this point. 

## What will you learn from this course

Leveraging an hypothetical [requirement](./stage%2000/specs.md), this bootcamp will guide you over tiny stages to gradually define and refine a compelling `software model`. Alongside his journey, one will be exposed to multiple dimensions a `software model` should cover. Unfolding each stage will fuel the reader with insights regarding both the matching `structurizr` syntax and the underlying `C4` philosophy.  

> The course is self-directed learning. You can do it at whatever pace you wish.

## How to get started

Here‚Äôs how the `C4 bootcamp` works.

### Use GitHub to Make Life Easy

This GitHub repository contains `workspaces` and other assets you will need to complete the bootcamp.

Thus, if you want to follow the bootcamp we recommend doing the following:

- Sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com), if you haven‚Äôt already.
- [Clone this repository](https://github.com/rvr06/c4-bootcamp.git) to your local machine.
- As you go through the project, keep a web browser tab open to the [c4 bootcamp](https://github.com/rvr06/c4-bootcamp/blob/main/README.md) so you can read all of the instructions clearly and easily.

### Bootcamp structure

`C4 bootcamp` consists of `17 stages`:

### Stage Layout

Each stage contains the following structure:

```cs
‚ï†‚ïê‚ïê Stage xx
‚ïë   ‚ï†‚ïê‚ïê README.md       // step-by-step recipe
‚ïë   ‚ï†‚ïê‚ïê theme*.dslf      // extra theme(s) definition (optional)
‚ïë   ‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê workspace.dsl   // completed lesson workspace
```

Each `C4 bootcamp` stage contains a `README` which explains the following:
1. The `Structurizr` concepts (eg ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/model-container-c92d39)) and tools you will be applying in the lesson, along with links to any relevant documentation or examples.
1. Step-by-step instructions (‚úèÔ∏è) on how to modify the `workspace` to match the expected one at the end of each lesson. Feel free to jump from ‚úèÔ∏è to ‚úèÔ∏è, if you want to quickly unfold the stage.
1. If you get stuck following the step-by-step instructions, each lesson contains check points (üìô) and a completed `workspace.dsl` (üìò) file that shows the expected output. You can compare this against your own code and see what you need to do differently.

Each stage enrichs the previous one, allowing one to tailor `software model` from scratch up to completion. If you are interested on an intermediate stage and don't want to unfold the whole journey prior to it, just take the previous state (`*.dsl` files) as your starting point. Eg, if you would like to exercise `stage 07`, just copy & paste `*.dsl` from `stage 06`, and engage.

### When you're doing the lessons...

A few things to bear in mind when you are following the step-by-step instructions:

1. **Don't just copy and paste** the code shown in the lesson's `README`. You'll retain and learn all of the built-in `Structurizr` functions if you type out the code as it's shown.
1. You might be required to fill in some blanks during individual lessons. Part of helping you learn `Structurizr` involves leaving some parts of the exercise up to you - if you ever feel lost, always check the contents of the `workspace.dsl` for that lesson.
1. Don't be afraid to ask questions.

### Docs

We will provide explanations of all key concepts throughout each lesson, but of course, you should bookmark (and feel free to use!) the [C4 documentation](https://supreme-happiness-8f0f8e3c.pages.github.io/)

### Tools / prerequisites

This course expects the following:
- A Github account and basic knowledge of Git
- An up to date installation of VS Code editor
- An up to date `Cornifer` extension
- An up & running docker daemon

See [here](./stage%2000/prereq.md) for details.
