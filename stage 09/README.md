In this module, you will learn how to:
- Define a `deployment group`
- Define an `infrastructure node`
- Enrich insights with `health check`[^1]

‚åõ Estimated time to complete: 45 min

## Define production deployment

When crafting a new deployment, you can either start from scratch or from an existing one. We take this last option here, duplicating previously created `dev_` `deployment environment`.

‚úèÔ∏è Update `model` section accordingly.

‚úèÔ∏è Amend some points:
- As we do have 2 personas, we have to materiliaze 2 user workstations, one hosting `MILA`, the other hosting `Icarus`.
- Obviously, `virtual device` is replaced by `mobile device`
- Kubernetes being the de-facto standard for remote orchestration, we swap previous `docker-compose` layer.

![](structurizr-1-ProdDeployment-nogroup.svg)

Every relationships is duplicated, as we do not specify how `Structurizr` should cluster deployed instances.

## Introduce deployment group

`Deployment group` is the `Structurizr` way to cluster stack, and enforce proper relationships bulkhead. 

‚úèÔ∏è Add 2 `deployment group` within `deploymentEnvironment` section.  
‚úèÔ∏è Dispatch `api` & `db` `container instances` among those 2 `deployment group`, leveraging dedicated `container instance` field.

## Enrich with health check

`Health check` is a widespread facility in Cloud environment. It allows an administrator or service to ping a dedicated URL to assess the health of an endpoint. Having an easy way of visualizing all ecosystem health at once is very useful when one would like to monitor or diagnose issue. 
 
‚úèÔ∏è Pick a `software system instance` or a `container instance` you would like to enrich, start typing `healthCheck`.

Let `Cornifer` be your guide: 

```c4u
healthCheck "name" url interval timeout
```

‚úèÔ∏è Fill in placeholders.

Assuming you have properly [instrumented](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks?view=aspnetcore-6.0) your API application, you should end up with:

        }
    }
```
</details><br> 

Sadly, at the time of writing, `Structurizr Lite` [does not support](https://structurizr.com/help/health-checks) `health check` view, where:
- `Healthy` elements are highlighted in green
- `Faulty` elements are highlighted in red
- `Blurry` elements are highlighted in amber

1. ‚úèÔ∏è Save you workspace and refresh your browser 
    ![](structurizr-1-ProdDeployment-health-check.svg)

Obviously, `health check` view performs this dynamically leveraging provided `healthCheck` url. Depending on what software you are working on, this single feature can justify the `Structurizr` paid upgrade.  

## Wrapup

üìò Completing this stage should lead to this [final workspace](./workspace.dsl).  

Whether you leverage autolayout or you tailor a custom one, ensure you keep [consistency](https://rvr06.github.io/c4-bootcamp/docs/usage/#layout-consistency) between related `view`. Here, you may notice how layout support difference spotting between `dev` & `prod` deployments, as everything is consistently dispatched.  

[Next chapter](../stage%2010/README.md) will go a step further to beautify deployment views.
